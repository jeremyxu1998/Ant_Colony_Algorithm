# Ant_Colony_Algorithm
This is an attempt to use ant colony algorithm to work on "Travelling Courier Problem" (a complicated version of Travelling Salesman Problem) for the milesotone 4 of ECE297 course project. Therefore, it must compile with the rest of the project code.

The algorithm send "ants" to travel over the points on the map through different paths and simulates ant pheromone to tune path selection probability of future ants. After iterations, the ants will tend to travel on a relatively optimized solution.

To understand how this whole algorithm works, I suggest checking out the wikipeida and various tutorial videos on Youtube.

This turned out to be a failed attempt however, because my implemented alogrithm requires large number of iterations to generate a relatively good result, which is not feasible within 30 seconds processing time limit in the project requirement.
